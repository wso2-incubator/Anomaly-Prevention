# Anomaly Prediction Using Unsupervised Machine Learning

## Introduction
This project provides the complete set of tools to train models and predict performance anomalies(specially memory anomalies) using the [WSO2 Data Analytic Server](http://wso2.com/products/data-analytics-server/) and [WSO2 Machine Learner](http://wso2.com/products/machine-learner/). Moreover, it provides pre-trained set of models with an ensemble predictor. A dashboard is provided with the tools which can be used to monitor the prediction results.

## Prerequisite
- [WSO2 DAS 3.1.0](http://wso2.com/products/data-analytics-server/) or later (Which includes all the other products WSO2 Machine Learner, WSO2 Template Manager and WSO2 Analytic Dashboard)
- [WSO2 DAS patches]() (Added for DAS 3.1.0 and ML 1.2.0)

## Installation
1. [Install JVM monitor agent](/jvm-monitor-agent/#installation)
2. [Install DAS Features](/features/#installation)
3. [Configure Ensemble Predictor](features#ensemble-predictor)
4. [Configure Dashboard view](features#dashboard-view)

## Deployment
1. [Run WSO2 DAS](https://docs.wso2.com/display/DAS310/Running+the+Product)
2. [Run JVM monitor agent](/jvm-monitor-agent/#deployment)
